# VellumCMS

**A minimalist CMS built for charities, nonprofits, and people solving real problems.**

VellumCMS is a content management system created for purpose-led organisations — with accessibility, privacy, and simplicity at its core. It's designed for charities that need control over their digital presence, without relying on tools built for corporations.

---

## Why VellumCMS?

This project exists because:

- Most CMS tools are bloated, expensive, or hard to trust
- Most open-source tools are built for developers, not real-world teams
- Mission-driven organisations deserve digital infrastructure they can rely on — and understand

VellumCMS is built to give that clarity and confidence. You don't have to wonder what it's doing behind the scenes — you can see it.
